#### User Installation (Recommended)
Installs zsh configuration for the current user only:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dominic-retrust/zsh-setup/main/auto-install.sh | bash
```

#### System-wide Installation (Root)
Installs zsh configuration system-wide for all users:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dominic-retrust/zsh-setup/main/auto-install.sh | sudo bash
```

**Installation will prompt you to select:**
1. **User install** - Install for current user only (in `~/.oh-my-zsh`)
2. **Root install** - Install system-wide for all users (in `/usr/local/share/oh-my-zsh`)

**This will:**
- ‚úÖ Install zsh, fzf, git, curl automatically
- ‚úÖ Configure Oh My Zsh with plugins
- ‚úÖ **Migrate environment variables from .bashrc** (NVM, Claude, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Set zsh as your default shell
- ‚úÖ No manual steps required!

Your `.zshrc` file is located at `~/.zshrc`. You can add your custom configurations at the bottom of the file.

### Change Theme

Edit `~/.zshrc` and change:
```bash
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

Popular themes: `agnoster`, `powerlevel10k`, `spaceship`

### Add Plugins

Edit the `plugins` array in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  # Add more plugins here
)
```

## Backup

The installation script automatically backs up your existing `.zshrc` to:
```
~/.zshrc.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

### zsh not found
Install zsh first:
```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

### fzf not found
Install fzf:
```bash
sudo apt install -y fzf  # Ubuntu/Debian
```

### Plugins not working
Reload your configuration:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Default shell not changed
Run manually:
```bash
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER
```
Then log out and log back in.

## Uninstall

To uninstall and restore bash:

```bash
# Remove Oh My Zsh
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh

# Restore backup
mv ~/.zshrc.backup.* ~/.zshrc

# Change default shell back to bash
sudo chsh -s $(which bash) $USER
```
